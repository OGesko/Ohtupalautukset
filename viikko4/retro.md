Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel and Glad, Sad, Mad are useful retrospective techniques for reviewing team processes and making improvements.
The Wheel method splits a circle into five sections: Start, Stop, Continue, More of, and Less of. Team members give feedback in these categories, focusing on actions to start, stop, continue, increase, or decrease. This quick method takes 10â€“25 minutes and focuses on practical changes for the future.
In Glad, Sad, Mad, participants categorize feedback as positive, negative, or frustrating. Notes are written on index cards, grouped on a board, and voted on for discussion. The technique lasts up to 60 minutes and helps prioritize key issues.
Both methods focus on creating actionable steps for the next sprint.
